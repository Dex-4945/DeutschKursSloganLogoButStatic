# DeutschKursSloganLogo
For the bac 3 Ihecs (communication) German course I designed this website as a media to add to our campaign. 
The goal was absolutely not to actually have a website, but in an attempt to provide something original, I quickly made this static website live at [https://deutschkurssloganlogobutstatic.onrender.com](https://deutschkurssloganlogobutstatic.onrender.com).

Hosted for free at [https://render.com/](https://render.com/), please be patient when loading the website, since it's free of charge, render turns its activity down when it's not being used, and needs to reactivate it. 

Again, this is for a language course, and has been coded in something like 2 half days, and this is one my very first websites :)
